""" 
The irregular beat generator

step 1: user input (BPM, maatsoort)
step 2: generate rhythm (note seq)
step 2.1: note dur to timestamps
step 3: transform timestamps to events
step 4: play events
step 5: store to MIDI? (user input)
step 6: store and/or loop

TO DO:
- netjes maken: alles van tags voorzien
- netjes maken: alle onzin weghalen
- User path netjes afwerken

Wan tijd over:
- work with off set?
- keuze uit kits
- kan het nog efficiÃ«nter?

- Er gaat iets fout bij het maken van timestamps. Ik zou eiglk overal moeten beginnen met 0 en dan met off set moeten werken maar dat heb ik niet.
